# Vault monitor

This small tool can be used to monitor the seal status of [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io). It will
periodically check [`/sys/seal-status`](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/system/seal-status.html) endpoint and push
results to [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

We use this tool to monitor the number of unsealed Vault instances in our Vault cluster. Because Vaults nature is
that it gets sealed after process restarts, and that the **unseal process should be done manually**, we wanted to get
notified when there is a need to perform manual Vault unseal. Pushing the number of unsealed instance count to AWS CloudWatch together with CoudWatch alarm allowed us to get notifications on such occasions.

## Usage

Environment Variables

- `CHECK_INTERVAL` - Time interval of how often to run the check (in seconds). (default: `60`)
- `VAULT_ADDR` - The address of the Vault server. (default: `https://127.0.0.1:8200`)
- `VAULT_NAME` - Name of the Vault (cluster). This value will be used as CloudWatch dimension value. (default: `Vault`)
- `METRIC_NAMESPACE` - AWS CloudWatch metric namespace. (default: `Vault`)
- `AWS_REGION` - AWS CloudWatch region. (default: `us-east-1`)

Alternatively CLI flags can be used and will override the value specified in environment variables.

- `-interval=60`
- `-address=https://127.0.0.1:8200`
- `-name=Vault`
- `-namespace=Vault`
- `-region=us-east-1`
